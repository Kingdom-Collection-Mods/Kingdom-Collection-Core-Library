#Donatist
 kc_donatist_agonistici_revolution_title:0 "Agonistici Revolution"
 kc_donatist_agonistici_revolution_desc:0 "When the Agonistici were founded centuries ago, they were composed of both Nobles and Peasants, the nobles did agree with most of the tenets of the Organization, they did oppose the idea of abolishing debt and property, but as time went on and less and less nobles joined the organization, the number of peasants have increased each year, and their ideas have gradually become more and more radical. Now with the revolution spreading across the world, the Clergy have become evermore fearful of the Agonistici, believing that soon enough the organization will act independently from them and begin to purge the merchant class of our nation, while nothing of the like has happened yet, the clergy has received quite a scare when a peasant leader came to the church of Carthage and demanded that he received an audience with the clergy of the state, while he was refused entry, we must consider our options for when he eventually comes back to demand our audience once more, a few of our officials have suggested to preemptively attack the Agonistici and hope that quells any idea of revolt, some have suggested to listen to the Agonistici in hopes of avoiding a great revolt, and a small number of our peers suggest we do nothing and keep to the status quo, no matter what we do, no one can disagree that something will change in the state of Carthage."

While these Berbers seemed to be disconnected from one another, that thought was proven wrong when a militia force brandishing clubs attacked a slave auction being conducted in secret at the city of Carthage, while the auctioneers had hired experienced blades men to ensure that the Auction would not be interrupted, the Berbers had outnumbered the mercenaries and at the end of a three hour long skirmish they obtained a decisive victory over the Slavers, with this victory they marched onto the church of Carthage and demanded to be both recognized as the Agonistici and to become an official army for the state of Carthage."
